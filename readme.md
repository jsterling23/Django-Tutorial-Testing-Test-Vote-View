# Django Testing View Example (vote)
> Django docs offer a tutorial over testing but lack an example for testing the vote view. I, never had done testing before, once I tackled it, I came up with this.


## Requirements 
> The urls.py is Django2.0 specific with the use of "path". The actual tests are not.

* Python 3.7.0
* Django 2.0.7

## Purpose
I wanted to put this up for anyone that is just getting throught the documentation and run into the "tests" section feeling dumbfounded. I avoided testing but given enough time, it proves to be worth it.

> I would also check out using coverage.py https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/coverage/coverage-4.5.1/coverage.pdf
> It helps! 

## Contributions

> Would love if anyone felt like giving feedback. Thanks!
